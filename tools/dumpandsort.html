    <div class="data">
        <p>Generate ideas rapidly and prioritize them based on two decision axes. Depending on how you arrange the XY axes criteria, one of the corners (usually top-right) will end up being highest combined value and that is what should be focused on immediately.</p>

        <p>Everyone spends 5-ish minutes writing as many ideas (based on the prompt, see "2X2 Axes" tab for options) as they can generate, writing one idea per sticky note. Participants then sort them into 2 equal columns, less good ideas and better ideas. Everyone then takes the less-good pile and passes it to their right, whereupon that person rips the stack of ideas up. Explained as "ideas are cheap, if it's good it will come back to you, self-editing makes us more free to ideate because we know our worst ideas won't be seen." Facilitator then draws a 2x2 on the board and gives 2 rules: half the stickies must be above the line and half must be below the line, and nothing can be on a line. If the participant cannot get enough things below the line, at the end erase the x-axis and just write it higher to split it evenly. Name the quadrants and tell the participant to focus ONLY on the top-right quadrant, as it's been identified as the best on both axes. </p>
