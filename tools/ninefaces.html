        <p>Take a sheet of paper. Fold it into 9 sections. In each section draw a face with eyes. Then permutate 3 variations of eyebrows (raised, level, down) down each column and 3 variations of smiles (happy, neutral, sad) across each row, so that raised/happy is in the top-left (gratitude usually) and down/sad is in the bottom-right (furious usually >:-( ). Considering each box to be your user in a different state, draw a thought bubble that expresses a feeling. Transfer the best face to a stick figure body and put them in a scene. Discuss and dot-vote. </p>
