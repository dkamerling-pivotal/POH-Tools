        <p>Open Sort: Write a bunch of things on cards. Ask users/facilitators to group them into what they consider to be logical categories. Afterwards, give each category a name. Alternatively, do a Closed Sort: write a few pre-determined category cards and see where users sort cards (or have trouble sorting cards).</p>
