        <p>Draw a bunch of horizontal lines, with vertical lines separating into columns. Each column represents a period in time. There are some "standard" row titles, but the benefit here is you can add any row that makes sense. The top row is usually "physical artifact", a picture of what the user is actually interacting with at that point of time. Other common rows are "user action", "thought", "front-end", "back-end", and "system 2". https://docs.google.com/document/d/17bzdxH0YaL-pHJTjtSKTKfUwNDIDFw1ppmPGxfXxzPE/edit?ts=562fd396</p>
