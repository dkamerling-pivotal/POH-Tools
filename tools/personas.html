        <p>Participants fold up a piece of paper into quadrants. The top-left quadrant has a drawing of a person in a place, doing an action, with a name, face, emotion, and thought. Bottom-left quadrant has relevant demographics (facts). Top-right quadrant contains behaviors (things they do). Bottom-right quadrant has needs and goals (what they want, pains, hopes). We all work silently then put them up on the board. Each person places a dot on the quadrant that they think best explains the user (so 4 dots in total - one on each quadrant across all papers). Highest vote quadrants are taped together and combined into one master persona. (Or, create a composite persona by pulling the highlighting individual items from each personal.)</p>
