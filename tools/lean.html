        <p>Fill out the template "We believe that (hypothesis). We will do/make (test). We will know this to be true if (measurable outcome and observable outcomes)."

Measurable outcomes should always be set, even if they're not going to be adhered to - it helps anchor expectations and drives towards a more concrete go/no go decision.</p>
