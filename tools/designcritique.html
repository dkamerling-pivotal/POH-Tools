        <p>Participants print out a few pages of their application that they would like feedback on. PMs and Designers walk up and silently look at the wires, placing dots near sections that trigger a thought (about flow, value, anything). Facilitators write their initials on the dot with a number and write the thought down on their card next to that number. At the end, a proctor goes up and calls out dots, whereupon the dotter shares their insight with the group. At the end, the participant collects all cards.</p>
