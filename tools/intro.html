<p>One of the big questions from new PMs has always been "where the hell do we learn all those cool exercises you guys use in Product Office Hours, D&Fs and the like?" To solve this, Lee Yanco created a knowledge base of our POH/decision-making techniques and exercises.  This website is an iteraciton on that to give Pivots something to reference and learn from, to help them make decisions about what exercises to use in what situations and how to do them.</p>
<p>You can find the original document <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14jkMwXlhfooHzTmOmL_PLPfQhnvwucooR2H20UjqkJg/edit#gid=0">here</a></p>

<p>This should be a living collection, so please feel free to suggest any exercises, explanations, or hot tips that may have been missed. Note that this is constrained specifically to POH/decision-making exercises - we could do entire other sheets on research techniques, synthesis techniques, retro formats, what have you.</p>

<p>Thanks, and happy decision making,</p>
