        <p>Identify what's causing people to gravitate towards and pull back from your product. Figure out if the company can double-down on or mitigate these forces.</p>

        <p>Draw out a rectangle, split into quadrants. On the left side, write "old solution". On the right side, write "new solution". In the top half draw an arrow going right and in the bottom half going left. The left side has things you can't control as well, right side has things you can control better. Top-left is a Push, "Push of the Current Situation" (I'm fed up with the status quo). Top-right is a Pull, "Magnetism of the new solution" (Ooooh, shiny! And it fits!). Bottom-right is a Push, "Anxiety of the new solution" (New things are scary, it might not do what I need, I'm uncertain). Bottom-left is a Pull, "Habit of the present" (Inertia, I'm lazy). Participants list forces to put in each diagram and then generate ideas for how the top half can be boosted and the bottom half can be mitigated.</p>
